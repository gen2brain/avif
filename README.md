Go encoder/decoder for [AV1 Image File Format (AVIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF) with support for animated AVIF images (decode only).

Based on [libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif) and [aom](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/) compiled to [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) and used with [wazero](https://wazero.io/) runtime (CGo-free).

The library will first try to use a dynamic/shared library (if installed) via [purego](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego) and will fall back to WASM.

### Build tags

* `nodynamic` - do not use dynamic/shared library (use only WASM)
